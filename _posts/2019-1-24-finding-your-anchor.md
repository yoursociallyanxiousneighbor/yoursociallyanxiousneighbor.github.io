You’re giving a toast for three hundred strangers at your best friend’s wedding tonight, and you’ve just woken up. 

The sun is shining – you can tell as an orange glow bleeds through the cracks between your blinds. The weather outside: 73. Your significant other is sleeping soundly, immersed in a peaceful dream.  

And how are you, emotionally, as you make your way to the bathroom?

You may as well be prepping for an apocalypse. 

Keeled over in the bathroom. Your eyes bloodshot, your back rounded as you hover over the toilet bowl. Cortisol and adrenaline shoot through your veins, as you now stagger towards the shower, reaching out a claw to turn on the water.

*But last night I felt pretty good!*
Why does this morning feel so much like *doomsday*? 

Let’s discuss this experience, which many of you may relate to in some degree. 

The first question: what are we scared of? In this example, it’s giving a toast to a large group of people. 

<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"

Often times when it comes to anxiety issues, the situations we fear are unlikely to lead to significant life change, even if they don’t go as well as we would like them to. (Otherwise, if we only worried about truly dangerous situations, like crossing the street in heavy traffic when it’s not our turn, than our nerves would be considered a healthy dose of protective anxiety).

For a fear of public speaking, we may be preoccupied with issues pertaining to how others perceive us. You may worry about stuttering and coming across as peculiar. Others may worry about turning red, forgetting what to say, etc. 

The list goes on and on, but each fear has one commonality: they are *not* life-changing ‘disasters.’ If they came true, it would *not* be a *doomsday*. 

But our brain, for some reason, is convinced otherwise and instead chooses to protect us from the battlefield by feeding us the fight or flight response. 

And you know what the intense, nervous symptoms do? They make us believe the toast *is* in fact a battlefield. And they make us believe that if we did stutter in this ‘battlefield,’ than the consequences would be unlivable, so we must instead avoid the situation at all costs to prevent ourselves from *losing everything*. 

Well that’s not logical, right? But we forget, as intelligent as we are. 

Let’s perform an exercise together that may help: 

Imagine a place that is constant in your life. A place where you truly feel comfortable, worry free. That no matter how devastatingly embarrassing a given experience may be, you can still come back to this place, no matter what, and nothing will change.

Is it your house? A parent’s house? 
It may be a public park. Your place of work.  
I personally like thinking of my grandparent’s house. I only have positive feelings associated with that place: Thanksgiving, pie, football, a lot of sitting on the couch. 

<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-2643102617846419"
     data-ad-slot="5404125293"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

You may not have a place in mind, but perhaps you have a person in mind. A person that isn’t going to change should you stammer in front of a hundred people. 

It could be a pet. You’re little cockadoodle looking at you right now with her tongue out. She’s not going to care if you forget your name while introducing yourself at a job interview. 

Whatever you think of, this is your *anchor*. Stammer, stutter, slur your words: that anchor isn’t moving. It doesn’t care if the storm carries ninety mile an hour winds, it’ll hold without any problem. 

Now try thinking of a few more while you’re at it. Make a list if you’d like. Feel free to add objects. A snowglobe. A candle. This website isn’t going anywhere – and I’m always available by email. So YSAN counts too, if you like. 

If you spend some time with this, you may develop quite a list of anchors. An extensive list of pieces in your life that will be with you, through and through, no matter the outcome of that nervous situation coming up. 
 
The sun will shine tomorrow as it did this morning. Your significant other is still going to happily dream. And you still may be keeled over in the bathroom. 

But *now*, you’ve given yourself an important reminder. You’ve started to recognize that perhaps there isn’t as much at stake. There is no apocalypse, thankfully, no matter how much our mind makes it seem.
