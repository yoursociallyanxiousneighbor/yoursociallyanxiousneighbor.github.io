I attended a gathering a couple days ago. It wasn’t a typical event – this was a get together to celebrate the life of a young woman who had recently passed away.

I’m close with the family and had known Sophie for many years. She was a brilliant, talented, kind-hearted young woman, a college student with numerous friends. Unfortunately, she struggled in recent years with depression, and her suicide was a shock to everyone who knew her. 

The celebration of her life consisted of musical performances by Sophie's peers along with multiple speakers. Her parents, other family members, and friends spoke to over a hundred people who were present. 

The parents wanted the attendees to reflect upon Sophie's contributions and her well-lived life. The family arranged everything, and I am in awe of their strength. 

The event was, in fact, as positive as it could be despite the deep grief. People were crying, but they were also laughing and listening intently to the music and spoken words. 

I hate to use this word, but it was, truly, “lovely.”

Now, the reason for this post is not to discuss the tragic passing of a family friend, but rather to discuss a specific instance that occurred at the gathering I feel is worth sharing.

One of the speakers was a friend of Sophie's. A college-aged, pretty girl who spoke about their friendship.
She spoke well, this friend (let’s call her Amanda). And it was touching. I vaguely knew Amanda’s mother, (we’ll call her Kathy), who was present in the audience. 

After a few sentences into Amanda’s speech, I glanced over at Kathy who was no longer in her chair. 

She was standing a little closer, with her iPhone held in front of her face, recording her daughter’s speech. 

I know this wasn’t technically a funeral, but it was unsettling to see Kathy doing this. Displaying your phone to discreetly check a text message is one thing, but I thought it was so odd to actually record your daughter like she was giving a speech at her high school graduation.
