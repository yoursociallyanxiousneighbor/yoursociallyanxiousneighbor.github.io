Just a few months ago everybody was talking about that 1.5 billion dollar MegaMillions jackpot up for grabs. I was only a text away from buying a $10 ticket from a friend. Fortunately, I ended up using my ten bucks on Chipotle instead. 

I’ve never gambled before, but this time it seemed so enticing. All those 0’s were pervasive on my newsfeed and in between classes in medical school we discussed what we would do with billions. Collectively, we agreed that if one of us won, he or she would pay off everyone’s student loans.
It was fun. You may not have even come close to buying a ticket, but I’m sure you thought at least once, what would you do with one and a half billion dollars, and how would your life change if you won? 
You’re probably wondering why is Michael bringing up old news? And you may also be wondering, why am I still reading this article?

Well, before you go, I’m referencing the Megamillions because for many of us out there like myself who have dealt with or are dealing with social anxiety, perhaps there’s an interesting link to human behavior.
Why do we want to buy that MegaMillions ticket to begin with? Why do we even give it our attention when we are well aware that there’s a one in a hundred million chance we’d ever win? 
For many of us, it’s because we can so easily imagine ourselves dancing on that brand new eighty foot yacht with the submarine. Or becoming a philanthropist and starting that wildlife conservation project we’ve always dreamt about. 

And when we picture our carefree, happy bodies in these extraordinary circumstances, even though there’s (really) no chance of that money falling into our lap, we feel an urge to buy into it. Because it feels real. If we can visualize it so clearly, then of course there’s a small chance of it happening. Of course I could, technically, be the lucky one. 

Now with anxiety, we envision ourselves in worst case scenarios (quite the opposite) before they happen. And are these worst case scenarios realistic? Usually not. And even if they do occur, the outcome is never as bad as we imagine. 

The outcome is never as bad as we feel it might be. But we believe in the unlikely possibility because we picture it so well in our heads. The anxious symptoms we get feel real (and very much are real), so we deduce that the upcoming event must be dangerous. And we buy into those feelings. We believe our brain when the symptoms warn us that stammering uncontrollably in front of a hundred people during our presentation will lead to eternal loneliness and hatred from the entire human race. Of course it won’t. And we know that. We’re smart. But the sweaty palms are telling us something different, and it can be very difficult for even the most intellectually gifted to disbelieve our nerves when the symptoms are so strong. 

Perhaps this is obvious for many of you. And I understand that recognizing how this relates to Powerball is not going to get rid of the nausea or the palpitations that we feel in certain situations. But for now, I believe it to be an important point to keep in mind for those out there dealing with any form of anxiety. Because it may help to provide an opening to step out of that very claustrophobic box that our fears can sometimes keep us in.
